# 3DViewer

A experimental ThreeJS viewer for OBJ and GLTF. You can manipulate lights intensity, color or angle via UI display. 

To display your gltf model, move its folder to the model folder, and replace the relative path in the loadObject method.

Use wamp server to run the project. Place the repository in C:/wamp64/www folder and open in Chrome.
